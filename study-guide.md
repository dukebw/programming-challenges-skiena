# Study Guide


Implement all data structures and algorithms from scratch.


## Data structures

- List structures: linked lists, arrays, dynamic arrays

- Set and map structures: hash maps, binary search trees, heaps


## Algorithms

- Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm

- Sorting algorithms: mergesort, quicksort, heapsort

- Binary search on an array
